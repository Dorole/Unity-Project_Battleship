# ✷✷✷ BATTLESHIP - UNITY 3D ✷✷✷

### Description
A classic two-player Battleship game. The game is played locally (hot seat). <br>
***
### Gameplay
At the beginning of the game the ships are randomly placed on the board for both players. <br>
The ships cannot be placed right next to each other in either direction. <br>
Each player has 7 ships:

Quantity | Size
------------ | -------------
2 | 1
2 | 2
1 | 3
1 | 4
1 | 5

On turn, a player can see his own board with the ships. The opponent's board is displayed as empty. <br>

The player clicks on a field on the opponent's board. If he guesses, the field shows up as red and he can guess again until he misses.
If he misses, the field shows up as gray and the turn passes over to the opponent.
